### Ricardo Sparapan :alien:ðŸ‘‹


- ðŸ”­ I currently work as a full stack developer at NeoAssist, we operate on a service platform and our goal is to change the status of service in Brazil and worldwide. 

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning more about Kafka and microservice architecture.

- âš¡ Fun fact: Even though I didn't have experience in the programming area, I risked a challenge in a company for a web developer job. I ended up in second place and was asked to be an intern, it was the perfect scenario for me. 

- :memo: I'm 21 years old and I'm passionate about technology. I like new challenges and especially to overcome expectations, always trying to learn and improve my techniques.
